# Flight Reservations Project 

This project would be used by airline staff to book and reserve flight reservations for passengers on any size flight. The software must be given a formatted tex file that describes the characteristics of the aircraft. </br>

### Text File Format:</br>
Line 1: Number of rows on the plane</br>
Line 2: Seats labels</br>
Line 3: Number of aisles</br>
Line 4: Number of First class rows</br>
Line 5: Number of Business class rows </br>
Line 6: Number of Coach class rows</br>

### How to run the program:
1. Start the file by running the FlightReservationsGUI.java 
2. You will be prompted to select a text file. Example test files can be found in the /test-files. 
3. Start by entering the passengers name
4. Select "Ticket" type (First Class, Business, Coach)
5. Select "Seat Preference" 
6. Click "Add Reservaton" </br>
