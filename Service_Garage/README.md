#Service Garage 
This software would be for an owner of service garage that will serve all kinds of cars and light trucks. 
The shop has plans for 30 service bays and almost as many mechanics to staff them. The job of the service manger is to schedule 
which vehicles go where and when. The garage also happens to offer a special paid "tier" plans whereby customers and get quicker service.
There are three tiers: Silver, Gold, and Platinum. Platinum vehicles get the fastest service, followed by gold, then by silver.
Vehicles with no plans get the slowest service (this was just for fun). The only exception to this is for hybrid or electric vehicles,
which may be serviced before others according to the restrictions of some service bays.
